# Stage 2: Main application with Fedora
# fedora-minimal is the slimmed-down Fedora base: same packages and repos as
# fedora:44 but without the full dnf/Python stack, so the image is noticeably
# smaller. It ships `microdnf` (a thin dnf5 frontend) instead of dnf — the only
# practical difference here is the command name; it still installs from RPM
# Fusion and supports --allowerasing. We stay in the Fedora family on purpose:
# it's the only mainstream distro whose stock FFmpeg (ffmpeg-free) bundles
# libopenh264 + the hardware encoders WITHOUT libx264 (see below), which keeps
# the encoder behaviour identical to the working host.
FROM registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora-minimal:44

# ffmpeg-free is Fedora's standard FFmpeg build (no libx264, but includes
# libopenh264, h264_vaapi, h264_nvenc, and h264_qsv).  This matches the
# working host environment exactly.  Do NOT swap this for RPM Fusion's
# `ffmpeg` package: it ships a different FFmpeg version with libx264, and
# libx264's output currently causes Discord to drop the stream after one frame.
#
# ffmpeg-free's h264_vaapi encoder is only the libva *loader* — it still needs a
# hardware-specific VA-API driver to reach the GPU. Fedora's stock VA-API drivers
# strip H.264/HEVC for patent reasons, so hardware H.264 encode needs the RPM
# Fusion builds. We install one driver per supported GPU vendor:
# * AMD -> mesa-va-drivers-freeworld (radeonsi) [RPM Fusion free]
# * Intel Gen8+ -> intel-media-driver (iHD) [RPM Fusion nonfree]
# * Intel pre-Gen8 -> libva-intel-driver (i965) [RPM Fusion free]
# Without the matching driver the h264_vaapi probe fails and the bot silently
# falls back to the libopenh264 software encoder. (NVIDIA uses h264_nvenc, not
# VA-API; that encoder is already compiled into ffmpeg-free and loads the host's
# libnvidia-encode at runtime via the NVIDIA container toolkit — no image package
# needed.) Fedora's libva searches /usr/lib64/dri, dri-freeworld and dri-nonfree
# by default and auto-selects the right driver from the /dev/dri device's PCI ID,
# so installing every driver side by side is enough; we deliberately do NOT
# hardcode LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME, which would force one vendor and break the others.
